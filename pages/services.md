        <h4>Refurbishments
&amp;
Alterations</h4>
        <p>Refurbishment and alteration work is, by its nature, diverse, covering project work ranging from a simple redecoration to the complete remodelling of an existing building.</p>
<p>Whether you need to re-model for more space, create open plan living by removing walls or install a new bathroom suite, The Building Company can provide you with all the services you need in order to fully renovate and refurbish your home.<br>
We will manage your project so that you have a single point of contact, whilst we liaise with tradespeople, architects, and planning departments on your behalf. We believe that good communication is the key to managing a successful renovation project and see our ability to develop good working relationships as one of our strengths.</p>
<p>We supply a full schedule of works so you can see your project in detail and understand exactly what work is being undertaken, it’s a meticulous process and we include all the predictable jobs – no hidden extras, no nasty surprises. Of course if you change your mind along the way we can quickly supply you with an alternative schedule and costing.</p>

        <h4>Extensions</h4>
        <p>An extension project can be a daunting sight as the work progresses, but we want our clients to feel at ease during building. That’s why one of our priorities is simply to stay in touch, to keep you informed about our progress with regular updates, so that you can be assured we’re managing the project properly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever home project you are planning, you need the reassurance that the builder is reliable, trustworthy and professional. The Building Company can offer this assurance, with references and by arrangement, accompanied visits to previous and current clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t just believe in delivering the highest standards, we believe in delivering these standards in the most cost-effective manner possible. Clever project management is all about working out how best to tackle the building process so that it runs as smoothly as possible. We think we are great at doing this. To assist with finances along the way we offer a staged payment plan, allowing you to pay at various agreed stages as the project is completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning is key. Before we begin a project, we draw up a full schedule of works. It’s a meticulous process, but we’ve been doing this for a lot of years and we’ve learnt that a little time spent here is better than a lot of time wasted later. Should an unforeseen setback occur – and occasionally this happens – we can quickly adjust our schedule to minimise potential delays.</span></p>
